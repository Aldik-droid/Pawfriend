This project focuses on excellent user experience, robust JavaScript functionality, and full compliance with modern web standards, including the implementation of Light and Dark Modes.

Features Implemented

Design Quality: Professional, polished design with relevant imagery and a clear, readable color scheme (Orange & Dark Blue).
Mode Toggle: Full Light and Dark Modes implemented and managed using Local Storage for persistence.

Enhanced JavaScript Functionality

Advanced Validation: Implemented robust form validation, including checks for required fields and password complexity (minimum length, uppercase, number, and symbol).
Search Persistence: The Pet List search feature saves the last search query to Local Storage, automatically filtering the results upon return for enhanced user convenience.
